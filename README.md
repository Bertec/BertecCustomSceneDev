    - Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract the contents.
2. **Open Unity and navigate to where you cloned the repository or extracted the ZIP file contents, and open the project from there**
3. **Select Your Scene Type and Start Building**
    - In Unity, choose between the **Visual Flow** or **Static Scene** options.
